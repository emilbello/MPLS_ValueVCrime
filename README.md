This project aims to assess the possible crime effect on housing value for the neighborhoods in the city of Minneapolis, MN, in the US. The study is focused on Residential areas, and the crime rates for different categories, including violent and non-violent crimes.

Is there less crime in affluent neighborhoods?
Is there more crime in poor neighborhoods?
Does housing value have impact on the type of crime (violent vs non-violent crime)?
Is household income related to housing value?
Is household income a factor in crime rate by neighborhood?
Is there a correlation between crime and household income?
